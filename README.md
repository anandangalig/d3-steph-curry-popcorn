# _Popcorn! According to Steph Curry_

#### 29 NBA arenas ranked on popcorn quality

## Description

_Who doesn't like popcorns, right?_

_Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry is apparently on a different level and a self described popcorn addict. According to [this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/12/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-popcorn.html), he ranked the popcorn offerings of all 29 NBA arenas (30 teams total, but Lakers and Clippers share Staples Center as home)_

_I scraped the article to collect the reported data and turned it into a JSON file. Then using D3.js library, I created a dynamic chart that visualizes the data little differently._
